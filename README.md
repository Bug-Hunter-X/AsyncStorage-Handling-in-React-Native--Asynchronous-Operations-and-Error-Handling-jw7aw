This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native related to AsyncStorage and provides a solution.  The bug stems from incorrectly handling asynchronous operations, potentially leading to data loss or UI inconsistencies.  The solution showcases proper promise handling and error checking to prevent such issues.  The included code examples illustrate both the problematic approach and the improved method.

In React Native, a subtle issue can arise when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  If you're not careful about how you handle asynchronous operations and error handling, it can lead to unexpected behavior, like data loss or UI inconsistencies. For instance, improperly handled promises or using the result of an async call before it resolves can cause issues.
